# Module

A Module is a collection of methods, constants, and class variables. Modules are defined as a class, but with the module keyword not with class keyword.

## Important Points about Modules:

You cannot inherit modules or you can’t create a subclass of a module.
Objects cannot be created from a module.
Modules are used as namespaces and as mixins.
All the classes are modules, but all the modules are not classes.
The class can use namespaces, but they cannot use mixins like modules.
The name of a module must start with a capital letter.
